            JavaScript is a very powerful client-side scripting language. 
            JavaScript is used mainly for enhancing the interaction of a user with the webpage. 
            In other words, you can make your webpage more lively and interactive, with the 
            help of JavaScript. JavaScript is also being used widely in game development and 
            Mobile application development. The language was initially called LiveScript 
            and was later renamed JavaScript.
            There are many programmers who think that JavaScript and Java are the same. 
            In fact, JavaScript and Java are very much unrelated.Java is a very complex 
            programming language whereas JavaScript is only a scripting language. 
            The syntax of JavaScript is mostly influenced by the programming language C.
